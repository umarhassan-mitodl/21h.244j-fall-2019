Peter the Great and the Petrine Reforms


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


What can you say about Peter’s reforms? Is there a pattern to his reforms that you can see? What do you think of the Table of Ranks in particular? Pushkin’s _Bronze Horseman_ is considered one of the great pieces of Russian literature of all time. What does it tell you about views of both Peter and his imperial city Petersburg?

From Peter the Great to Catherine the Great


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Why did royal succession become a thorny problem in the 18th century? What was the relationship between the tsar and nobility? One historian refers to the 18th century the “empire of the nobility.” Why might this have been the case? Why was the Constitutional Crisis of 1730 such a key event? Why do you think Peter III chose to “emancipate” the nobles in 1762? What effect do you think this might have had on the social structure of the country? What can we learn about the economy and culture of the nobility from Shcherbatov’s lament “on the corruption of morals”?

Catherine the Great as Woman and Ruler


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Catherine II staged a coup against her husband Peter III in 1762 with the help of her guardsmen, especially the Orlov brothers. What can we learn about imperial power from this coup and how it was carried out? Catherine prided herself on having a number of “enlightened” ideas about how Russia should be run as shown in her “Instruction” to the Legislative Commission and her Charter to the Nobility. How did she instruct the Legislative Commission? What was her vision and what were her key ideas? What difference do you think it made (or failed to make) that she was a woman and a foreigner?

Nicholas II, Industrialization, and Radicalization


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


What were Sergei Witte’s prescriptions for industrializing Russia? What were some of the pros and cons of his position? How well do you think Witte’s and Nicholas II’s ideals worked together?

Discussion questions for Von Laue, Theodore H. “First Crisis, 1900-1905.” Chapter 3 in _Why Lenin? Why Stalin? A Reappraisal of the Russian Revolution, 1900–1930_. 2nd ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 1971. ISBN: 9780397472000.

*   Why does Von Laue open with “the riddle of backwardness”? What can you learn in this chapter about what was considered “backwards” in Russia?
*   Why might Sergei Witte have been rather similar to an MIT student? How might he have been different?
*   What were Witte’s top priorities? How do these compare with other countries’ efforts to modernize their economies? What did industrialization and modernization entail for Russia?
*   What were the responses in Russia to Witte’s initiatives?
*   Why do nobles fear and distrust Witte? What did government ministers think of him? How did Witte work with them?
*   Why did Witte want to reform or abolish the peasant commune?
*   Why was Nicholas II a problem for those who sought to modernize Russia? Why does Von Laue say that the autocrat’s _job_ was the problem?
*   Why might this kind of non-consultative government have been good for Witte?
*   What does Von Laue see as the two main choices and why was this a genuine dilemma? What might you have done?
*   How do reality and propaganda square at this time?
*   What does the general population want? What can we learn about the changing social structure at this time?
*   Why is the state itself the object of a long list of grievances? See if you can make a list of some the most important.

{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


How well do you think the constitutional monarchy worked? What were some of its strengths and weaknesses? What were some of the causes and consequences of WWI for Russia?
